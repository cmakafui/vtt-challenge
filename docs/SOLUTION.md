# VTT Innovation Disambiguation Solution

**Team:** vtt-challenge  
**Challenge:** VTT Innovation De-duplication & Aggregation  
**Submission Date:** June 2025

---

## Executive Summary

We developed a complete **AI-powered pipeline** that transforms VTT's fragmented innovation data into a clean, canonical knowledge graph. Our solution eliminates the critical "Innovation Ambiguity" problem where the same real-world innovation appears as multiple disconnected mentions across different sources.

**Key Innovation:** A three-stage automated pipeline combining **FAISS semantic search**, **GPT-4.1 intelligent reasoning**, and **graph database curation** that preserves complete provenance while creating canonical innovation entities.

## The Problem We Solved

### Innovation Ambiguity Challenge

VTT's innovation data exists fragmented across multiple sources:

```
❌ BEFORE: Multiple disconnected nodes
├── "Solar Foods protein production technology"
├── "Neo-Carbon Food protein production process"
└── "Protein from air by VTT & LUT"
```

```
✅ AFTER: Single canonical innovation
└── "Advanced Protein Synthesis from CO2"
    ├── Full provenance to all 3 original mentions
    ├── Complete organization relationships
    └── Semantic embeddings for discovery
```

This fragmentation made it impossible for VTT to:

- Get accurate portfolio overviews
- Track true collaboration patterns
- Identify genuine innovation vs. re-mentions
- Make evidence-based strategic decisions

---

## Our Solution: Intelligent Three-Stage Pipeline

### Stage 1: FAISS Semantic Analysis

In the pipeline directory, we have a script that uses FAISS to find similar innovations.

**`scripts/ambiguity_analysis.py`**

- Processes GraphDocument extractions from VTT and partner websites
- Generates Azure OpenAI embeddings with full context (names, descriptions, URLs)
- Uses FAISS for high-performance similarity search
- Identifies candidate duplicate pairs with contextual signals

```bash
# Identify potential duplicates across all data sources
uv run python scripts/innovations_analysis.py analyze \
    --similarity-threshold 0.80 \
    --dimensions 1024
```

### Stage 2: LLM Agent + MCP Server

**`agents/innovation-curator-agent.ts` + `mcp/innovation_entity_server.py`**

- **LLM Agent**: GPT-4.1-mini analyzes each candidate pair with rich context
- **MCP Server**: Provides graph operation tools for entity management
- **Decision Making**: SAME/DIFFERENT reasoning with confidence scoring
- **Graph Updates**: Automated canonical entity creation and relationship management

```bash
# Start MCP server for graph operations
uv run fastmcp run mcp/innovation_entity_server.py --transport sse --port 9000

# Run intelligent curation agent
bun run agents/innovation-curator-agent.ts duplicates.json
```

### Stage 3: Canonical Graph Population

**`scripts/ingest_entities.py`**

- High-performance batch loading into Memgraph
- Creates clean canonical knowledge graph
- Preserves complete audit trails through "thick edges"

```bash
# Batch populate resolved entities
uv run python scripts/ingest_entities.py ingest glossary.json duplicates.json
```

## Technical Innovation Highlights

### 1. Context-Aware Duplicate Detection

Our FAISS analysis goes beyond simple text similarity:

- **URL Matching**: Same source documents boost confidence
- **Organization Overlap**: Shared collaborators indicate potential duplicates
- **Domain Analysis**: Cross-dataset validation (VTT + Partner mentions)
- **Temporal Context**: Publication dates and document types

### 2. LLM-Powered Intelligent Curation

The GPT-4.1-mini agent makes nuanced decisions using:

```typescript
// Rich context analysis for each candidate pair
const prompt = `
Compare these innovations considering:
- Technical descriptions and core methods
- Organizational contexts and roles  
- Source URLs and publication metadata
- Language variations (EN/FI)
- Project phases vs. distinct innovations
`;
```

### 3. "Thick Edge" Graph Architecture

Our Memgraph schema preserves **complete provenance**:

```cypher
(VTT:Organization)-[:INVOLVED_IN {
    mentions: [
        {
            name_in_mention: "Solar Foods protein tech",
            source_url: "https://vtt.fi/news/solarfoods",
            role_in_mention: "Lead Developer",
            publication_date: "2023-01-15"
        },
        {
            name_in_mention: "Air protein technology",
            source_url: "https://partner.com/collaboration",
            role_in_mention: "Research Partner"
        }
    ],
    primary_role: "Lead Developer"
}]->(ProteinSynthesis:Innovation)
```

### 4. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

We built custom MCP tools for seamless LLM-graph interaction:

- `resolve_or_create_canonical_innovation` - Smart entity resolution
- `search_similar_innovations` - Vector-powered similarity search
- `merge_innovations` - Intelligent duplicate consolidation
- `add_mention_to_link` - Provenance-preserving relationship creation
